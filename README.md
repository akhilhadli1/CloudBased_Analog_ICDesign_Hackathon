# Three-Transistor-Two-Input-Universal-NAND-Gate
3T two input NAND gate is a low power implementation of Conventional CMOS NAND gate which requires 4 transistor using pass transistor logic
# About Hacakthon
IIT Hyderabad in collaboration with Synopsys & VSD wants to generate skilled manpower in the domain of IC design, which will strengthen the decision of the Indian Government for the silicon revolution. The Indian Govt initiative Chips to Startup (C2S) aims to propel innovation, build domestic capacities to ensure hardware sovereignty, and build a Semiconductor Ecosystem that requires 85,000+ highly trained engineers. Working towards this vision statement, we have planned the 3-Week “Cloud based Analog IC Design Hackathon using Synopsys Custom Design Platform”.

# Abstract
VLSI circuits consists of various analog and digital elements to achive the system specifications. Most of the systems we see currently are digital and  with some part as analog block.These blocks are bulit with the basic building blocks namely logic gates AND,OR,NOR,XOR,NAND.In these gates NAND and NOR are Universal gates i.e all the gates  can be obtaines using universal gates .In particular NAND gate is most used due to its advantages over NOR gate like it is  fast than NOR .So optimizing NAND gate implemetation with less area will automatically reduce the cost in bulding large circuits.In this Project NAND gate is implemented with 3 transistor unlike the CMOS implementation which has four tansistor to reduce area and power.This gate is Implemented in 28 nm Bulk Cmos Synopsys PDK.
