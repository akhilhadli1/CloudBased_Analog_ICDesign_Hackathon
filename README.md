# Three-Transistor-Two-Input-Universal-NAND-Gate
3T two input NAND gate is a low power implementation of Conventional CMOS NAND gate which requires 4 transistor using pass transistor logic
# About Hacakthon
IIT Hyderabad in collaboration with Synopsys & VSD wants to generate skilled manpower in the domain of IC design, which will strengthen the decision of the Indian Government for the silicon revolution. The Indian Govt initiative Chips to Startup (C2S) aims to propel innovation, build domestic capacities to ensure hardware sovereignty, and build a Semiconductor Ecosystem that requires 85,000+ highly trained engineers. Working towards this vision statement, we have planned the 3-Week “Cloud based Analog IC Design Hackathon using Synopsys Custom Design Platform”.
